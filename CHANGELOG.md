# Changelog

All notable changes to sn-rights-signals are documented here.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-23

### New

- Initial release. Serves the machine-readable rights-signal surface for
  juanlentino.com: TDMRep (header pair, `<head>` meta tags, and
  `/.well-known/tdmrep.json`), an RSL 1.0 licence at `/license.xml`, a
  `License:` directive appended to `/robots.txt`, TDM headers on every
  `/wp-json/*` response, and a placeholder `/tdm-policy/` page pending
  counsel's terms.
- `GET /_sn/rights-signals/version` for deploy verification.

### Known limitation

- `Content-Signal: ai-input=yes` cannot be set from this repo. Cloudflare's
  managed content-signals feature wraps its own `robots.txt` block around
  whatever this Worker returns, after the Worker runs — the `Content-Signal`
  line is never visible to Worker code, and Cloudflare's dashboard doesn't
  yet expose an `ai-input` toggle. See README "Known limitation" for detail
  and the owner-side options.
